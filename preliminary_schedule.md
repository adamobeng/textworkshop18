## Roundtables

The idea of a roundtable is to get a set of 3-6 people working a lot in this area to identify the issues, spark a discussion and debate to identify the issues, and get the conversation flowing.  From these will arise points to work on in Day 2.  Everyone is assigned somewhere.

**Chairs:** I will try to set an example for what it means to be a "Chair" in session 1.  Chairs are also participants in the roundtable, but should think of some questions to get the discussion going.  I (Ken) will try to set an example in RT 1.
