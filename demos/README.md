# Demos and benchmarks

Use this set of folders to submit demonstrations, benchmarks, texts, etc.  

## Guidelines

None really, except to do something cool, and reproducible.  Ideally it would also be code where someone else could adapt it easily for testing with alternative tools.

## Instructions

1. **Fork the repo** (or clone locally).

2. **Create a subdirectory** for your demo, e.g. `awesomedemo/`.

3. **Save your demo as `README.md`** in that subdirectory.

4. **Include the data** needed for knitting the `.Rmd` file.  If this is not possible, suggest a way for others to obtain this data (for instance a Dropbox link sent upon request.)

5. **Knit the document** so that it produces `README.md`.  This will render as HTML when viewed in a web browser directly from GitHub.

6. **Issue a pull request**, and we will pull it into the repo!
